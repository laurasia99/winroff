Neatroff for Microsoft Windows
==============================

This project contains scripts that build a complete neatroff installation
for Microsoft Windows, using the Microsoft C++ toolset from the command
line. Information on using the Microsoft command line tools can be found
here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/building-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170

Assumptions:
    -   Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio installed
    -   Git installed and usable from the Windows Command Shell
        See https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
        or https://gitforwindows.org/
    -   Curl and tar usable from the Windows Command Shell.
        These tools are included with recent builds of Windows 10
        (see https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/)


Steps:
    1/  Open a windows command prompt with the development environment
        (refer to the above article for instructions)

    2/  Check that the Microsoft command line tools are accessible.
        This can be done by using the 'where' command:

            > where nmake

        The response "INFO: Could not find files for the given pattern(s)"
        indicates a problem with the development enviroment - resolve this
        before progressing

    3/  Clone this repository

            > git clone https://github.com/laurasia99/winroff

        This creates the subdirectory 'winroff'. Change into it (cd winroff).

    4/  Review NMakefile-local, and make changes required for your development
        environment.

    5/  Run nmake (no options required; uses Makefile)

            > nmake

        This will download the subprojects.

    6/  Run nmake again (no options required; uses Makefile)

            > nmake

        This will build the required subprojects, and download fonts
        (if this is configured)
